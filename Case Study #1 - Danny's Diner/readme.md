SELECT customer_id, 
		SUM(price) as total_amount
FROM dannys_diner.sales s
LEFT JOIN dannys_diner.menu m
ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id
````
#### Answer:
| customer_id | total_sales |

**2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?**
````sql

FROM dannys_diner.sales

| customer_id | visit_count |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 4          |
| B           | 6          |

**3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?**

````sql
--Approach_1
WITH cte AS(

	FROM 
	dannys_diner.sales
)
SELECT customer_id, 
  product_name
FROM cte c
JOIN dannys_diner.menu m
ON c.product_id = m.product_id
WHERE order_chronology = 1
GROUP BY customer_id, product_name;	

--Approach_2 (Using sting_agg function)
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT *,
           DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date) AS order_chronology
    FROM dannys_diner.sales
),cte2 AS (
	SELECT DISTINCT c.customer_id, m.product_name, c.order_date
	FROM cte c
	JOIN dannys_diner.menu m ON c.product_id = m.product_id
	WHERE c.order_chronology = 1
)
SELECT customer_id,
	STRING_AGG(product_name, ',') WITHIN GROUP(ORDER BY order_date) as first_order
FROM cte2
GROUP BY customer_id
````

````sql
SELECT TOP 1 m.product_name most_purchased_item,
	COUNT(1) as count
FROM dannys_diner.sales s
JOIN dannys_diner.menu m
ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY s.product_id, m.product_name
ORDER BY COUNT(1) DESC;
````
#### Answer:
| most_purchased | product_name | 
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 8       | ramen |
***

**5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?**

````sql
WITH cte AS (
	SELECT s.customer_id,
		   m.product_name,

	LEFT JOIN dannys_diner.menu m
	ON s.product_id = m.product_id
	GROUP BY customer_id, product_name
),cte2 AS (
	SELECT *,
			MAX(popular_fg) OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id) as most_popular
	FROM cte
)
SELECT customer_id,
	   STRING_AGG(product_name,', ') WITHIN GROUP(ORDER BY customer_id) as most_popular
	FROM cte2
WHERE popular_fg = most_popular
GROUP BY customer_id
