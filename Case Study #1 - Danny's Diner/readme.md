## Question and Solution
**1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**
````sql
SELECT customer_id, 
		SUM(price) as total_amount
FROM dannys_diner.sales s
LEFT JOIN dannys_diner.menu m
ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id
````
#### Answer:
| customer_id | total_sales |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 76          |
| B           | 74          |
| C           | 36          |

**2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?**

###  Bonus Questions

#### Join All The Things
Create basic data tables that Danny and his team can use to quickly derive insights without needing to join the underlying tables using SQL. Fill Member column as 'N' if the purchase was made before becoming a member and 'Y' if the after is amde after joining the membership.

#### Rank All The Things
Danny also requires further information about the ranking of customer products, but he purposely does not need the ranking for non-member purchases so he expects null ranking values for the records when customers are not yet part of the loyalty program.

```sql
WITH cte AS (
	SELECT s.customer_id,
		   s.order_date,

	LEFT JOIN dannys_diner.menu m
	ON s.product_id = m.product_id
	LEFT JOIN dannys_diner.members mb
	ON s.customer_id = mb.customer_id
)
SELECT *,
		CASE WHEN member = 'N' THEN null 
			ELSE DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id, member ORDER BY order_date)
